[XClone][XClone repo] is a statistical method to detect allele- and 
haplotype-specific copy number variations (CNVs) and reconstruct 
tumour clonal substructure from scRNA-seq data, 
by integrating the expression levels (read depth ratio; RDR signals) and 
the allelic balance (B-allele frequency; BAF signals).
It takes three matrices as input: the allele-specific *AD* and *DP* matrices
(BAF signals) and the *total read depth* matrix (RDR signals).

The [xcltk][xcltk repo] package implements a preprocessing pipeline to 
generate the three matrices from SAM/BAM/CRAM files.
It supports data from multiple single-cell sequencing platforms, including 
droplet-based (e.g., 10x Genomics) and well-based (e.g., SMART-seq)
platforms.

## News

You can find the full manual of the xcltk preprocessing pipeline at
[preprocess/README.md][preprocess manual].

All release notes are available at [docs/release.rst][release]


## Installation

### Install via pip (latest stable version)

xcltk is avaliable through [pypi][pypi].

```shell
pip install -U xcltk
```

### Install from this Github Repo (latest stable/dev version)

```shell
pip install -U git+https://github.com/hxj5/xcltk
```

In either case, if you don't have write permission for your current Python
environment, we suggest creating a separate [conda][conda] environment 
or add `--user` for your current one.


## Manual

You can check the full parameters with `xcltk -h`.
