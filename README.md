xcltk is a toolkit for XClone (warning: under development, not stable)

All release notes are available at [doc/release.rst][release]

## Installation

xcltk is avaliable through [pypi][pypi]. To install, type the following command 
line, and add `-U` for upgrading:

```shell
pip install -U xcltk
```

Alternatively, you can install from this GitHub repository for latest (often 
development) version by following command line

```shell
pip install -U git+https://github.com/hxj5/xcltk
```

In either case, if you don't have write permission for your current Python environment,
 we suggest creating a separate [conda][conda] environment or add --user for your 
current one.
